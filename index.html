            I was a hacker at the first of its kind event at the Rashtrapati Bhavan and worked on the social issue of monitoring loos at public places.My team built an Android app for users to detect nearby loos with ratings provided by other users,allowing users to provide feedback and add toilets if the data was missing.We had a web based dashboard for the government to monitor status and revenue. Sensors were embedded into the solution to track the cleanliness of the loo and gamification was brought in to award the best maintained loos to bring in a sense of ownership.I was indeed privileged to have an interaction with the Honourable President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee

            Was winner at the Bangalore Dc and qualified as a finalist for the Global Hackathon for my hack-Swipe in your Stress. Description: Occupational stress is on the rise and it has a negative impact on oneâ€™s health and productivity and has also been identified as a key factor for the rising attrition rates at companies. We have developed an elegant solution to tackle stress management which will be embedded into the biometric SWIPE IN machines that will capture the Employees pulse using sensors. By performing computations on the pulse data we will be able to get an insight on the Employee's stress levels .We have a supporting Android app which will help you monitor the stress levels and alleviate it through recommendations. Constantly high stress patterns will be reported to the corresponding Managers as well. http://devpost.com/software/globsol

The customer gets an option to see the ads he/she likes and also gets notification based on the content of their choice.We build a message mining app based on filters values set by a user like BOGO,onions at 15rs,snacktime deals etc. A back-end CRM analytics tool will be available with Opinio that will help them understand user wants, plan their logistics accordingly and utilise data to have better partnerships with their service providers.
