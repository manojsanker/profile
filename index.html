Patents an Intelligent wearable device to recognise emotions in children with Autism India Patent Application 4808/CHE/2013   Inventors: Manoj Sanker P R
patent for my device EMOTE SENSOR-an Intelligent  wearable monitoring device to aid            children with Autism.
Publications Recognition of emotions in autistic children using physiological signals Journal-Health and Technology ,Publisher-Springer   March 14, 2016 Authors: Manoj Sanker P R, Karthik Anantharam
Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) cannot express their emotions explicitly; this makes it difficult for the parents and caretakers associated with these children to understand the child’s behavior, leading to a major setback in the child’s early developmental stages. Studies have shown that a human being’s physiological changes are directly related to his/her psychological reaction. In this paper we propose a wearable wristband for acquiring physiological signals and an algorithm, using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, that will predict emotional states such as neutral, happy & involvement of children with autism. The psychological reactions (or emotions) are recognized based on the changes in the bodily parameters (physiological basis) such as the galvanic skin response (GSR) and heart rate variability (HRV). For this purpose, vital features extracted from the recorded physiological signals are classified into different emotional states using SVM, which resulted in an overall accuracy of 90 %. This will help the parents and the care takers to understand the emotional patterns of the child better. Intelligent System Enabling Speech to Sign Language Conversion International Jouranal of  Recent Advances in Engineering and Technology,Vol2,Issue2 2014   Authors: Manoj Sanker P R, Karthik Anantharam
This paper discusses an effective algorithm to convert speech signal to sign language so that the deaf and dumb can interact and communicate effectively in a classroom setup thus enhancing the overall communication.

Projects Emote Sensor December 2012 to May 2014 Members:Manoj Sanker P R
“Emote Sensor”- is a monitoring wearable device to aid autistic kids by emotional mapping.This device helps the caretaker understand the emotions of the child by tapping into the physiological parameters of the child like heart rate, Galvanic skin response and temperature. The device has its supporting backend on an Android app that runs on the device in the hands of the caretaker. My contribution was mainly in the field of the product design, developing calibration techniques and signal processing .Pilot testing of the device is being carried out at AHSA and NIMHANS,Bangalore.A business plan proposed around this device was chosen to represent India at the Intel Global Challenge at University of California Berkley Pulse of a Billion-a portable digital telemedicine kit December 2012 to June 2013

Members:Manoj Sanker P R, Vijay Sadashivaiah, Ruchika Shivaswamy
It is portable biometric tricorder that consists of an E smart stethoscope made from e waste, a head mount camera and a wearable pulse meter .This device can be used to enhance telemedicine in rural India through remote diagnosis.The project consisted of medical experts too.My major contribution was in the the  domains of signal acquisition and    signal processing and a cloud based telemedicine framework setup. Data Acquisition and Analysis Using Image Processing February 2013 to May 2013 Members:Manoj Sanker P R
Image processing tools in Matlab were utilized to automate the process of product stock updation .The punch cards     from the manufacturing units were scanned and using image processing the holes count which correspond to product   stock, were calculated and updated in the database. This project was done to match the requirements of the Brewery industries at Bangalore.

Page6
   Occupational stress is on the rise and it has a negative impact on one’s health and productivity and has also been identified as a key factor for the rising attrition rates at companies. We have developed an elegant solution to tackle stress management which will be embedded into the biometric SWIPE IN machines that will capture the Employees pulse using sensors. By performing computations on the pulse data we will be able to get an insight on the Employee's stress levels .We have a supporting Android app which will help you monitor the stress levels and alleviate it through recommendations. Constantly high stress patterns will be reported to the corresponding Managers as well. http://devpost.com/software/globsol Runners up at the Next Big Idea 2013 IIM-B and supported by Intel and Department of Science and Technology ,Govt.Of India .
